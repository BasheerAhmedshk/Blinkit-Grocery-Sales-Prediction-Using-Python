# Blinkit Grocery Sales Prediction System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Blinkit Sales Prediction System is a retail demand forecasting solution leveraging **Facebook Prophet** for time series analysis, supported by a modern **FastAPI backend** and an **interactive Chart.js dashboard**. It predicts grocery sales trends by modeling seasonality, holidays, and irregular business events, enabling data-driven inventory and sales planning.

## ðŸ”‘ Features

- **Forecasting with Prophet**

  - Decomposes sales data into trend, seasonality, and holiday effects.
  - Handles weekly, monthly, and annual patterns.
  - Provides uncertainty intervals for reliable predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**

  - Missing value imputation (mean/mode handling).
  - Feature engineering: business maturity, visibility normalization.
  - One-hot encoding for categorical attributes.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**

  - Time-based 80/20 train-test split.
  - Metrics: RÂ², MAE, RMSE.
  - Supports walk-forward and rolling cross-validation.
- **System Architecture**

  - **Backend**: FastAPI with async support, model serialization via joblib.
  - **Frontend**: Chart.js for responsive, real-time visualizations.
  - **APIs**: Swagger docs, async predictions, secure endpoints with auth & rate limiting.
- **Scalability & Real-time Data**

  - Batch integration via Airflow.
  - Streaming ingestion with Kafka.
  - Redis caching for performance optimization.
- **Quality Assurance & Monitoring**

  - Statistical residual and stationarity tests.
  - Error handling with graceful fallback.
  - Performance logging and monitoring.
- **Security**

  - Data anonymization and aggregation.
  - Role-based access controls.
  - API authentication, authorization, and throttling.
